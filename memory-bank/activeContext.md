## Active Context

**Current Work Focus:**
- Updating the memory bank files to reflect the current state of the `first.py` and `easy_ai.py` implementation.

**Recent Changes:**
- Implemented the `EasyAI` class in `easy_ai.py`.
- Integrated `EasyAI` into `first.py`, replacing the old `Robo_Judge` logic.

**Next Steps:**
- Review and potentially refactor game logic in `first.py`.
- Design and implement the save/load game feature.
- Start working on UI improvements.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**
- Ensuring memory bank accurately reflects the codebase.
- Planning the data structure for saving game progress.
- Evaluating UI framework options (Pygame/Tkinter).
