- Inability to save and resume games, leading to frustration for players.
- Outdated user interface that doesn't appeal to contemporary users.

The enhanced Ludo game should provide a seamless and intuitive user experience. The AI opponent should offer varying levels of difficulty (Easy level implemented via `EasyAI`). The save/load feature should allow players to easily continue their games at any time. The user interface should be visually appealing and responsive across different devices.

**User Experience Goals:**
- Create a fun and engaging gaming experience.
- Provide AI opponents with varying difficulty levels (Easy level implemented).
- Ensure ease of use and intuitive navigation.
