## Progress

**What Works:**
- Project virtual environment is set up.
- Core game logic in `first.py` (using Tkinter).
- Implementation of an "Easy" level AI opponent (`EasyAI` class in `easy_ai.py`).
- Integration of `EasyAI` into `first.py` to control the Red player when playing against the computer.
- Memory bank files documenting the current state.

**What's Left to Build:**
- Implementation of Medium/Hard AI difficulty levels (potentially using Strategy pattern).
- Save/load game feature.
- UI improvements (graphics, animations, responsiveness).
- Refactoring/cleanup of `first.py` might be beneficial.
- Comprehensive testing.

**Current Status:**
- Basic Ludo game playable against an Easy AI opponent.
- Core AI structure (`EasyAI`) is in place.
- Memory bank is updated to reflect the current implementation.

**Known Issues:**
- The `first.py` code is quite long and could benefit from refactoring into smaller modules/classes.
- UI is basic Tkinter, lacks modern polish.
- No save/load functionality yet.
- Only one AI difficulty level implemented.
