## System Patterns

**System Architecture:**
The Ludo game enhancement follows a somewhat modular approach, with the core game logic and UI in `first.py` and the AI logic separated into `easy_ai.py`. Further modularization (e.g., separating UI, game state, core logic) is possible. Planned features include modules for save/load and potentially more advanced UI.

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Using Python for the AI opponent (`easy_ai.py`) and game logic (`first.py`).
- Using Tkinter for the current user interface (within `first.py`).
- Planning to use JSON for saving and loading game progress.

**Design Patterns:**
- **State Pattern:** Implemented within `EasyAI` (`easy_ai.py`) to switch between `RANDOM`, `BASIC`, and `SAFE` behavioral states.
- **Strategy Pattern:** Could be used in the future to implement different AI difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) by encapsulating different AI logic (like `EasyAI`) under a common interface.
- **Observer Pattern:** Could be beneficial for decoupling UI updates from game state changes if the UI is refactored.
- **Singleton Pattern:** Could potentially manage global game state if refactored.

**Component Relationships:**
- The `EasyAI` module (`easy_ai.py`) provides the `EasyAI` class.
- The main game module (`first.py`) creates an instance of `EasyAI` when playing against the computer.
- `first.py` calls the `EasyAI.make_move()` method to get the AI's decision.
- `first.py` handles all game logic, UI updates (Tkinter), and player input.
- Future save/load module will interact with the game state (currently managed within `Ludo_Game` class in `first.py`).
- Future UI improvements might replace or augment the Tkinter implementation in `first.py`.
